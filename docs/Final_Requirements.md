IT342 – Required System Features (Final Implementation)
Your approved system concept remains the same.
The following features are now MANDATORY for your implementation.
All features below must be working during Final Defense.
1. Authentication & Security (Required)
Your system must implement:
• User Registration
• User Login
• JWT Authentication
• Logout
• Password hashing (BCrypt)
• Protected routes/pages
• /me endpoint (get current authenticated user)

2. Role-Based Access Control (Required)
• Minimum 2 user roles
• API-level role restriction
• UI-level role restriction
Example:
• Admin can manage data
• Regular user has limited access
3. Core Business Module (Required)
Your system must include:
• At least 1 major entity (Except User entity
• Full CRUD operations
• Proper validation
Example:
• Orders → OrderItems
• Projects → Tasks
• Users → Appointments
4. System Integration Features (ALL REQUIRED)
Your system must implement ALL the following integrations:
4.1. External API Integration
• Must consume a real public API
• Must be used in a meaningful feature
• Data must be displayed in your system
4.2. Google OAuth Login (or any other Authentication server/Social Login)
• Login using Google or other
• User saved/linked in database
• Must generate your own JWT after OAuth login
4.3. File Upload (depends on the business domain)
• Upload file (image/pdf/etc.)
• File stored on server
• File linked to database record
• User can view/download it
4.4. Payment Gateway Integration (Sandbox Only)
• Payment integration is required only if it makes sense for your system.

• Use real payment provider (Test Mode)
• Record payment results in database
• Handle success and failure
No simulated payment allowed.
4.5. Real-Time Feature (Optional – Bonus)
Use either:
• WebSocket (recommended), OR
• Polling (auto-refresh every few seconds)
Must demonstrate live updates between users.
4.6. Email Sending (SMTP)
Must send:
• One account-related email (e.g., welcome, verification)
• One system notification email (e.g., receipt, approval)
Console print is NOT accepted.
4.7. Backend
• Spring Boot (Java 17+)
• Spring Security + JWT
• JPA/Hibernate
• MySQL or PostgreSQL or MongoDB or Firebase
Backend must be custom-built using Spring Boot.
No Backend-as-a-Service.
4.8. Web Application
• ReactJS
• Must consume the Spring Boot REST API
• Must implement protected routes
No mock or hardcoded data.

5. Database Requirements

• Minimum 5 database tables
• Proper relationships (One-to-Many or Many-to-One)
• No plain-text passwords
• Proper normalization (avoid duplicate data)
• Use DTOs (do not expose password in API responses)

6. Architecture Requirements
Your backend must follow a clear System Architecture Pattern.
Examples:
• Layered Architecture
• Clean Architecture
• Modular structure
Minimum requirement:
• Controller layer
• Service layer
• Repository layer
• DTOs
• Security configuration
• Global exception handling
You must include:
• Architecture diagram in documentation

• Short explanation of the pattern you used
Must use:
• Proper HTTP status codes
• RESTful endpoint naming
7. Mobile Application Requirement (REQUIRED)
Your system must include a working Android mobile application that integrates with your
backend API.
7.1. Technology Requirement (STRICT)
The mobile application must:
• Use Android Kotlin
• Use XML-Based UI Layouts
• Use Android API Level 34 (Android 14)
• Use Retrofit for API integration
• Connect to the SAME backend used by the web application
Jetpack Compose is NOT allowed.
Mock data is NOT allowed.
7.2. Authentication Integration
• Login using backend JWT authentication
• Store JWT securely
• Send JWT in Authorization header
• Access protected endpoints
7.3. Core Module Consumption
• Display data from the Core Business Module
• Access at least 5 protected API endpoint
• Handle error responses properly
7.4. Role Awareness
• UI must adjust based on user role
• Unauthorized actions must not be allowed
7.5. Proper API Integration
• Use Retrofit (or equivalent)
• No hardcoded/mock data
• Must connect to actual backend server
8. Application Name
Effective application names are short, memorable, and often reflect the core functionality
Ideal names consist of one or two words, are easy to pronounce, and often use suffixes like -
ify, -io, or -ly to create unique, brandable, and modern-sounding titles.
